        <i><p class="small-paragraph">After you helped the Orcs and Goblins regain their power, one civilization that was hiding in the woods until now decided it was time for action. The Woodelves have come out of hiding and will show you how you should be dealing with those random dangerous races you have been awakening and empowering so far. This advanced people thrives on everything natural and you will find that they can build the most amazing things in and from nature. But, they are also a bit... hard to deal with. They have quite a strong mindset and may not always see you as... well, they may not even always see you.</p>
