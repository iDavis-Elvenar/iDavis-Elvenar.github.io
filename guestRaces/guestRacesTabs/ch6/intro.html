        <i><p class="small-paragraph">Those of you who have progressed to the end of the current research tree will find a completely new chapter. A chapter about the first guests in your city: the Dwarves. It is up to you to help bring back the Dwarven culture to its former glory, so that the Dwarves can carry on on their own again. During this journey, you will face exciting challenges for yourself and your city.</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">To start helping the Dwarves, you will need to research the Dwarven Portal, through which the Dwarves will be able to enter your city. This Portal will need to be connected to your Main Hall to allow the Dwarves into your city. The Dwarven structures need to be connected to the Dwarven Portal. For this, you will need some of new streets that the Dwarves have developed. You will be able to build new buildings from the Dwarven culture that you will need to help the Dwarven race flourish once more.</p>
