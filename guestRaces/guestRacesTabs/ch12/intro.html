        <i><p class="small-paragraph">The Elementals are a very old and mystical race that lives in another dimension. Their boisterous power of nature is bound into magic masks that enable them to take a stable shape. For instance, they can use the masks to appear in a humanoid shape to interact with other races (remember the Masquerade event?). Without their masks, they would not be much more than uncontrolled fire, water, air and earth, so the masks are quite vital to their cultural existence.</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">Unfortunately, they lack the precise knowledge how to build these masks on their own. That is why they lived in a kind of symbiosis with the Elvenar. The mighty, god-like Elvenar helped them to create the masks, and in turn the Elementals used their power to build up glorious cities and also legendary armies. No other race would dare to threaten the Elvenar when they are supported by such a powerful force.</p>
            
            <p class="small-paragraph">Every few centuries, the Elementals have to revisit Elvenar to renew their masks - and their collaboration and friendship with the Elvenar. That is why they suddenly pop up in your town, expecting you to be the Ancient Elvenar. When they find out that you are indeed not the Elvenar, they start to worry a lot about their own future. They decide to build up a Settlement in your town to help you regain access to the knowledge of your ancestors - ultimately to help them to survive.</p>
            
            <p class="small-paragraph">In the process, they teach you the basics of how to produce Sentient Goods, a technique that future Guest Races will further improve. The Elementals start with showing you how to produce Platinum, Moonstones and Elven Tree Gum using the Divine Seeds. This will enable you to progress through the Tech Tree and unlock improved versions not only of your own buildings, but also of the Settlement Buildings, which are unlocked level by level this time. Thus, as a player, you can watch step by step in the Settlement, how the instable Elementals of the beginning slowly regain control of their shape and build more and more stable structures and in the end proper buildings.</p>
            
            <p class="small-paragraph">Can you save the Elementals before they cease to exist and turn into pure elements? And can you prove to be the true heir to the Elvenar?</p>
