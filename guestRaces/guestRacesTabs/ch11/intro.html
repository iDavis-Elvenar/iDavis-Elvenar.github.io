        <i><p class="small-paragraph">Halflings have found their way to your city and they want you to celebrate the ultimate Harvest Festival with them! In this new Chapter you will learn all about their enthusiasm. They see you as their savior and their gratitude knows no limits. They immediately spread out into all provinces you have completed and populate the "known and secured lands". From then on, Halflings from every completed province will send a small amount of a new resource, Seeds, to your trader where you can collect it daily after you upgraded it. Seeds, like Mana, is a decaying resource. The amount of Seeds you get on a daily basis, depends on your number of completed provinces, your Main Hall level and the combined levels of all your Ancient Wonders! The more you login to early-collect, the more bonus seeds you will get!</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">Of course, there's also a group of Halflings that wants to stay and settle in your town. Their goal is to celebrate the ultimate harvest festival with you, their savior. Therefore, they build up a giant farm, where all kinds of fruits are cultivated. The date of the harvest festival draws nearer and nearer and there's still so much to plant and grow and harvest... Will your town be ready for the ultimate party in time?</p>
