        <i><p class="small-paragraph">Finally, after years of separation and with help of the Constructs, Elves and Humans team up to work on a new structure, a building designed as a tribute to the High Men. Right after finishing the construction, a beacon of light magically activates from within the structure. Ethereal shapes begin to dance around the light, slowly forming bigger figures. Finally, all the shapes pull back into the beacon of light and a second goes by where time seems to stand still. Suddenly, radiant and ancient beings can be observed stepping out of the pulsing beam. The arrival of the Elvenar has finally come.</p>
