        <i><p class="small-paragraph">Since your city has developed and is now using Mana regularly, the Sorcerers have picked up on your newly gained powers. Their magic finds its source in Mana, and with the big waves of this powerful force coming from your city now, the Sorcerers found their way to your city and want to share their knowledge with you. The most advanced Sorcerers of the three magic disciplins, have decided to found a university in your city to help your people gain more knowledge about Mana and other forms of magic. The Sorcerer's Campus will attract apprentices, and the bigger it gets, the more apprentices can be found studying at the new university, increasing their knowledge - and yours! The apprentices can study one of the three disciplins to become Arcanists, Alchemists, and Necromancers. Later on, each graduate can also go for a second study in one of the other disciplins, mastering a second art.</p>
