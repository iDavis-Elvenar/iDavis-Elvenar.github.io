        <i><p class="small-paragraph">The dispute between you and the Elvenar is escalating. The Elvenar insist on focusing on the ascension and not increase other races' dependency on you. They urge the Humans and Elves to stay out of other races' affairs because in the end it will hold back everyone. The Humans and Elves however don't want to accept this and try to be a helping hand for everyone who kindly asks. The Constructs observed the tension for quite some time and, as their "common child", feel the obligation to interfere. They ask the Humans and Elves to seek help from the Elementals - the only known race that is even older, and hopefully wiser, than the Elvenar. With their millennia of experience and friendship, the Elementals should be able to settle the dispute between ancestors and descendants.</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">Using Unurium, the Constructs teach Humans and Elves to construct a portal to the dimension of the Elementals. Will the Elementals be happy to help, and will Humans, Elves and Elvenar be able to put aside their differences?</p>
