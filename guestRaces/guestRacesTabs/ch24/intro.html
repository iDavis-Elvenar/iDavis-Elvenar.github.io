        <i><p class="small-paragraph">While Athadon and Xandra try to convince you that Enar has no interest in your fate at best, or at worst is working to make it a cruel one, the Amuni return to your city. Bastet Sothep VII wants to personally demonstrate how the Amuni's way of life has changed since your last encounter. And since she has heard that the city feels threatened by some false deities, she "generously" offers to place your people under her personal protection. To this end, she wants to build a new temple complex in which her magical abilities, which she calls "Nox" to distinguish them from Mana, can be strengthened and developed.</p>

<p class="small-paragraph">Nox is a magical force that can be stored in spiritually charged obsidian and channeled and used by magically gifted beings like the Bastet. Bastet Sothep VII orders large quantities of this special obsidian from the region where the Amunis settled on, to be brought to your city via your trader, while the construction of the temple complex begins. This brings the Elvarian Sorcerers Society into action. Dean Durcu suspects that Nox is nothing less than the forbidden Black Magic - and that Bastet Sothep VII is a tool of Vallorion.</p>

<p class="small-paragraph">Necromancer Bastaran takes a liking to this new form of magic and suggests examining it more closely - without repeating the mistakes that Peregrim made. He brings up the idea to build another temple structure similar to that of the Amuni, promising to only use Mana while studying Nox, in order to better understand the effects and differences of these magical sources.
Dean Durku is not too happy but allows it, and Alchemist Sylawney decides to watch this from a distance.</p>

<p class="small-paragraph">Bastet Sothep VII finds Bastaran's idea presumptuous, but believes that in this competition of magics, the superiority of Nox can be clearly demonstrated. So as the second temple is built in the city to examine the mutual powers of Mana and Nox, the Bastet is pushing for upgrades of the first temple - and Bastaran tries to keep up.</p>

<p class="small-paragraph">The Elvenar already see it as progress that you are reducing your dependence on Mana and establishing a certain balance of power in the city, but they warn that this power could quickly get out of control - as already happened to Peregrim.
Bastet Sothep VII can only laugh at such objections - after all, she is a goddess and thus the sovereign ruler of the Nox.</p>

        <div class="card-spoiler-visualOnly border-spoiler mb-3" style="width: 100%; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 2%; padding-right: 2%;">

        <b>Nox</b> is a new Discovered Resource (similarly to Orcs, Mana, Seeds, Unurium, Community Work and Canned Goods).
        It is produced inside Trader - next to the Seeds and Unurium. 
        It occupies the same production slot, so you will need to make strategic choices about which resource to produce first.<br><br>

        After unlocking the very first technology of this chapter, you will be able to see Nox right below the Mana in the "Discovered Resources" column:<br><br>

        Note that only Trader upgraded to level 10 starts to produce Nox. Once upgraded, your can see this production ability in the Trader window.<br><br>

        Similarly to other Discovered resources, Nox will decay every night.
