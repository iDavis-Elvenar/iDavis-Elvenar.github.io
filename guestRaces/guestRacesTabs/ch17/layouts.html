        <li>The following three layouts are constructed so that the production of each guild takes approximately the same amount of time. This means that the number of ships from different guilds in your city may not be the same.<br> 
            The first layout consumes 4x4 expansions, the second one consumes 4x5 expansions, and the third one takes 5x5 expansions. The more ships you build, the faster you can complete this chapter.<br><br>

        <li>The following two layouts are bigger (making your progress to be even faster if you can afford that much space), but do not have the amount of ships calculated relatively to their productions (so it is possible that one guild
            will end up producing a bit more than the other).<br><br>
        </li>

        <li>Back when I was going through this chapter, I gave it second name - Demolishers from Unur. This is one of the few chapters that - except for the space - cost you almost nothing when you keep increasing the size of your settlement. So,
            you can just teleport some buildings to your inventory and add additional small ships. I remember half of my city being covered with ships only - but it did its job. :)<br><br>
