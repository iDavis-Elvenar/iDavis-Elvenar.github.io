        <i><p class="small-paragraph">After helping the Dwarves and Fairies settle their age-old differences, you reach out to the Elves and Humans again in an attempt to intensify your relationships. The Elvenar are very satisfied that their descendants finally seem to focus on their own matters. To support your development, they call the Constructs and request an upgrade for the Trader to import Unurium. This precious resource is brought directly from Unur, where the Constructs produce this invention-inspiring material in their main settlement.</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">What the Elvenar didn't expect was that another flying ship quietly followed the Constructs on their journey from Unur, all the way over the ocean - a pirate ship! The pirate captain storms into your Main Hall, takes your advisor hostage and demands that the destruction of his home be stopped immediately.</p>
            
            <p class="small-paragraph">Can you clear up the confusion and reveal why the pirates went on their journey from a still deserted part of Unur to your city to direct their demands to you? Will you figure out why they see the Constructs as a threat to their home and lifestyle? And most importantly, will your decisions please the Elvenar?</p>
            
            <p class="small-paragraph">Explore this new Chapter in the story of Elvenar, build a commercial port, and learn more about the three factions of the Traders of Unur, as well as their motives, lifestyle and precious wares! And who knows, maybe you will even learn a valuable lesson on camaraderie in the process!</p>
