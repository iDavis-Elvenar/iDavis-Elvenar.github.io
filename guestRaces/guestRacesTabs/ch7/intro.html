        <i><p class="small-paragraph">New visitors requiring your assistance showed up at your city's gates today: the Fairies need some help re-establishing their once great, and nature-oriented culture. The Fairies have immense knowledge of nature and will bring you new production techniques, which you will need to use to help restore the Fairy race to its former glory. They are not the best of friends with the Dwarves, though, so you will need to make sure that the Dwarves can stand on their own feet again before you start helping the Fairies, or the Fairy Queen may not be so pleased... if you don't, you may have to find a way to combine the strengths of the Dwarves and the Fairies. Once their numbers have increased a bit, the Fairies will be able to introduce you to eight new Goods that they can produce for you using mainly coins, supplies and Crafted Goods. You will need these new Goods to help research more the more advanced Fairy buildings.</p>
