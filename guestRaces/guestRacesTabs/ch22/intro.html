        <i><p class="small-paragraph">The heavy rain falls as the horde of the newly proclaimed King Bruitemail and his advisor Matad prepare to leave your town. Bruitemail tells you that this reminds him of an orcish legend his mum used to tell:</p>
            <p class="small-paragraph">"When the great leader sacrifices himself, the heavens will start to cry and won't stop until the swamp is everywhere. This marks the return of the Purring Warlord, the divine patron of the Orcs, and the beginning of the glorious Age of Desaster, where Orcs rule the World!"</p>
            <p class="small-paragraph">While you wonder if the "Purring Warlord" is the orcish title of Vallorion, reports reach your city that the ongoing rain caused floods in lower parts of the country, especially some regions close to the sea.</p>
            <p class="small-paragraph">Suddenly, there's an earthquake in your town, after which the rain seems to stop. You discover a crack in the ground that quickly fills with water, creating a new lake close to your city. The Orc horde leaves your town.</p>
            <p class="small-paragraph">Valara arrives shortly thereafter, telling you about a completely destroyed Halflings settlement that was built at the beach, and all inhabitants have gone missing. You fear the worst. While Valara catches her breath, you check out the new lake nearby. To everyone's surprise, a strange submarine that seems to almost fall apart is spotted in the middle of the lake.</p>
            <p class="small-paragraph">"What the heck? Is this a whale with a giant backpack?"</p>

        <b>Canned Goods</b> is a new Discovered Resource (similarly to Orcs, Mana, Seeds, Unurium and Community Work).
        It is produced inside Workshops - the Toolbox production (24h) is replaced by the production of Canned Goods. 
        The production time of Canned Goods is 9 hours and they decay, left unused. Similarly to Coins, Supplies and Community Work, the Canned Goods receive cultural bonus.<br><br>

        After unlocking the very first technology of this chapter, you will be able to see Canned Goods right below the Community Work in the "Discovered Resources" column:<br><br>

        Note that only Workshops upgraded to levels unlocked by Chapter 22 start to produce Canned Goods. When upgrading from level 47, you can see this production ability
        in the upgrade window.<br><br>
