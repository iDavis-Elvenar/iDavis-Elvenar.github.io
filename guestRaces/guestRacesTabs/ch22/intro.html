        <i><p class="small-paragraph">Captain Bonkers, leader of the Pirate Guild, pays us a visit and brags that he found a yet unknown island of giant proportions, filled with precious treasures. He offers some mysterious pearls he found there, that are said to bring prosperity to whoever possesses them. While our Mentor is a bit skeptical of buying stuff whose origin is unknown, our Trader is very fascinated and convinces everyone to accept the offer.</p>

            <p class="small-paragraph">Just when Captain Bonkers has left, a horde of dragon-riding Orcs attacks the town, including an angry Orc warlady. It turns out that Captain Bonkers stole the pearls from the warlady of the Orc tribe that lives there - and they followed his traces all the way to your town.</p>

        <b>Canned Goods</b> is a new Discovered Resource (similarly to Orcs, Mana, Seeds, Unurium and Community Work).
        It is produced inside Workshops - the Toolbox production (24h) is replaced by the production of Canned Goods. 
        The production time of Canned Goods is 9 hours and they decay, left unused. Similarly to Coins, Supplies and Community Work, the Canned Goods receive cultural bonus.<br><br>

        After unlocking the very first technology of this chapter, you will be able to see Canned Goods right below the Community Work in the "Discovered Resources" column:<br><br>

        Note that only Workshops upgraded to levels unlocked by Chapter 22 start to produce Canned Goods. When upgrading from level 47, you can see this production ability
        in the upgrade window.<br><br>
