Walking over the flower fields being pollinated somehow feels like home…<br>But on that morning, his life would change, and a new view of the world will be presented. All the pollen in the air made the environment beautiful like a yellow filter applied to all the colored flowers, but, as good as it could be for the plants, the pollen seems not to work well with this frolic's goblin nose. The yellow “magical” particles make it itch and, as much as he tries to hold it, the stronger the urges become until…. Poof… with a powerful sneeze, the goblin changes again into a flower.<br>That was it, that was the feeling he was missing. It was not anymore about the heat of the fire camps, the thrill of the pillage, or the taste of the strong ales produced by his people. What he missed was nature, his connection to it, and his ability to change common landscapes into majestic natural sculptures. The Flower Goblin is again the Flower Goblin and that was delicious, the feeling to be part of a whole, the connection to the Fauna and the Flora was something incredibly fulfilling. With a smile the Goblin touches the ground again, feeling the pleasant textures of the mud between its fingers, and in the silence of his mind, he hears the thoughts and experience the feeling of the living beings around it.<br>The Goblin decides to use this power to continue his artwork and support his friends and with the help of the Lord he will take life and color for all the parts of the Elvenar continent.`,
