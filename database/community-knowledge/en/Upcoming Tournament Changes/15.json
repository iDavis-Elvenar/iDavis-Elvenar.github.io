This would also require a corresponding increase in support buildings such as residences, workshops etc. [BR][BR]This looks completely unbalanced to me. I assume that the catering difference is due primarily to the many ancient wonder levels in my advanced city. The wonder benefit to manufactories (notably via Mountain Halls) is already included in the above figures.

Yes, the troop size requirement is about 8% less but the ratio between enemy troop size and mine is the same for both cities. This means my chances of winning is the same if I have that many troops to send in. Therefore, you have a valid point. Can the increase in wonder levels contribute to higher unit production at this rate? Since I have a lot of military wonders the answer is yes for me. My first city product 14% more troops compared to the second city. I don't know how it will work for a player who is more into negotiation.Click to expand...This only counts for a certain amount of wonderlevels. once you have maxed out those military wonders in theory you could max out unit production and power with ~ 200 wonderlevels if you target specific wonders after that your unit power and production will no longer rise, while your SS still grows and grows and grows."}, {"112": "Should have read the Beta testing, I had held off investing in the final chapters optional Squad size increase but with the launch of the new Tourney system I finally maxed out the squad size option, only to struggle to complete provinces that were easy in every other tourney. My city is maxed on expansions and has researched and built all the final Chapters technology and I am finding I cant complete a lot of Round 2 encounters now through battle, and that is forcing me to burn far more resources than before through catering. Very disappointing Elvenar, I have used twice the resources to get half as far as I would normally. I can see a lot of people leaving the game if this isn't handled better."}]
