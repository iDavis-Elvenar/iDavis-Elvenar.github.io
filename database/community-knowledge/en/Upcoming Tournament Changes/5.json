It seems that the end players aren't important to Inno, after all its taking them months and months to bring out the next chapter and so they seem to have decided that it should take players the same amount of time.

I'm confident that the majority of AWs will still benefit people to upgrade, but there are some that won't. One interesting one that came up recently is Timewarp. We have a Beta fellow who was able to place a second Polar Bear and he's worked out that even though he just filled his Timewarp with KP he's not going to upgrade it because that extra level would just make his tournaments harder.

There are other parts of the game too [smilie--sprite2]Click to expand...When I started to play this game, about 4 years ago, first city was in En2 and after some months in En1. Once I hit guests races I started to develop them differently. En2 was the fighter, En1 was the negotiator, because, as you said, I thought are different parts of the game, all helping a player to develop his/her city. After another year, with the path set by Inno, I found myself with a crippled city in En1, was hard to get decent scores in Tournaments, cause always I was limited by Orcs. Eventually I switched that city to fighting because THIS WAS THE PATH what Inno wanted us to follow!!!! (and with this changes, I will quit playing in En1 [even tho the city is in ch.16] and in En3 too, cuz I lost the fun.)[BR]What you are saying it's like blaming the victim. We did what we supposed to do in the terms set by Inno. It took me years to adjust everything to those terms > KPs instants instead of normal KPs, Seeds depending on the total amount of Wonder levels. I developed a whole strategy to grow my city, to get the best out of this game, I spent money to buy diamonds for what???? To get a hard kick in the rear for all those things?[BR]So, show me what are the other parts worth spending time playing this game? Upgrading stuff > taking days, collecting/ restarting production > oh yeah, very entertaining indeed, the Spire > crippling your troops or depleting your stocks?

Tournaments have gotten way out of hand with the amount of rewards being given out, but it is Inno who has created this monster, allowing people to reach these levels. This means for many people there are years' worth of adjustments towards having a tournament orientated city and we have all been steered strongly in that direction.[BR][BR]I am not averse to it changing, but the way they have done it isn't right. They have decided that the big tournament players only make up a tiny proportion of the player base so they can get away with upsetting these people more, but they are also the backbone of the game, the forums, and the community.
