I have the ones I like the least at level 6, others level 7, others near 10, the MM to 15, and Needles to 31.[BR][BR]I also have premium expansions, a bunch, and I am only in S&D (43.5K AW pts), so its going to be interesting.[BR][BR]Hence, the reason I shared of other aspects. I am the only one that said \"relics\"... yeah, those relics... you have scores of those, they are worse than garbage, right? If you add you food crafting, and your CCs crafting, plus leveling up (now much slower) your AWs... you will be short of relics in 2-3 months. Maybe 6 months or a year if you played since the game loaded for the first time haha, but you will run out.[BR][BR]So this means fewer CCs... something you need (also for pet food), for most crafts, except that sweet KP craft that costs 8 broken shards and a few spell fragments. And broken shards... the amount will be reduced, and also, your actual runes will reduce too. We will run shorter on both WS and \"heating the sun\" spells, but apparently we will need more troops.[BR][BR]The economy changed when the tiers changed. The foundation of the economy, or half of it, started to shift when AW KPs decreased from 45, to 25 diamonds each. With tournament changes, the economy will transform, and that's never easy, but we will manage... our way to play and grow will change, but the Spire is becoming even easier, which is a relief, as the Spire provides important stuff... and those Spire sets will increase exponentially in value.[BR][BR]I enjoyed my last (for now I guess) max 5th round. 46 provinces [smilie--sprite1], and will six-star them, as a memento haha.

If you lived there, (Chicago, New York, San Diego, Boston, I know no more) we must understand.

With these two it's partly because I haven't upgraded either past level 3. The Lighthouse was an experimental idea to boost my coin production through increased culture bonus, but the effect is so far minimal. Right now I can do without ST because I am always awash with seeds, except for the times I am trying to work through a chapter (which, frankly, might never happen again). I'm just not sure how much impact it will have if my seed decay goes back to 10%.[BR][BR]I am loathed to sell my Thrones of the High Men or Watchtower Ruins, despite them being obvious choices. I don't care at all about the ranking points Thrones gives, but I built it in the first place because I love the building so much - that hasn't changed, so I should stick to my guns. Also, both these Wonders are giving me over 20k culture each so in terms of coin production they might be more important to me than the Lighthouse. It's hard to really say, when all those two Wonders have to do is ensure my culture bonus stays on full sun, whereas Lighthouse gives extra.[BR][BR]The last candidate is the Great Bell Spire. I've kept this around since the great nerf. The biggest reason is its effect on Neighbourly Help duration. The same goes, again, for Watchtower Ruins. The two of those kind of work together.[BR][BR]All these Wonders don't hurt me at all right now, save for the space they are sitting on, so with the slightly loose arguments above I have no temptation to get rid of any, but once all their respective levels start hurting my tournaments then it becomes increasingly difficult to not consider axing them."}, {"22": "Interestingly though, to add - in my Beta city, which is now nearing the guest races, I wouldn't consider building any of the above now (along with, of course, the Maze, Enar's Embassy and Blooming Trader Guild.)"}, {"2": "I am thinking at the players who will hit ch.15 and 16 with these new changes ... how many months will they need to complete those two chapters?
