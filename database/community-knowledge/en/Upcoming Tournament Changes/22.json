That is not the case. this is Crystal tourney and last week was Planks. I of course cannot guarantee anything, since I donÂ´t know what they did, but so far we are getting exactly the troops we expected, and I assume this will continue.[BR][BR]The game has reduced its options to 3 kinds of each type of unit I believe, that makes a total of 15 possible units. I wonder why they limit themselves that much, because one of their goals was more diversity.[BR]Each weak 1 or 2 types (3 or 6 units) will be favored. [BR][BR]Planks has always been with a main unit of LR, so it was also in the new one. Means most units you encounter every time is LR. I assume that each of the 3 LR units has the same chance of showing up (but that may not be true).[BR][BR]Crystal has always been a weird tourney, with the main type being mages, but the tourney actually being focused on the 2 support types, one of which (HR) had a greater variety of units than the main type. So now we get a tourney with 2 Main types, the previous main type Mage and the previously most diverse type HR. [BR][BR]At least so far we have been getting what was expected. But even if the trend does not not continue (I think they mentioned something about HM in Silk???) I am sure that all the main units for all the tourneys have already been set. They are not going to change them based on feedback every week.[BR][BR]The bad news for you: next week is scrolls tourney, which has always been a LR tourney, which means Scrolls will be exactly the same tourney as Planks. the only possible difference I can see is the introduction of a second main type (M or HR), if they wanted to make sure that no 2 tourneys are exactly the same. introducing another main type would reduce LR (and therefore Mistwalker) occurrence a little bit compared to Planks, but up from this weeks Crystal.[BR][BR]Anyway I am glad units are not completely random, so we actually get different tourneys every week, I personally would like it if they kept the old main types with potentially a second main types (out of the previous supporting types), so the tourneys stay similar to what they used to be in at least some way. eventhough of course difficulties will change a lot and for example Planks and Scrolls would end up being a similar difficulty.[BR][BR]Silent Tempest said:Of the 13 times Light Ranged units appeared there were 6 instances where they were Mistwalkers, i.e. nearly 50% of the time. Considering the variety of available Light Ranged units the weighting towards Mistwalkers is TOO HIGH.Click to expand...[BR]I do not see any evil design here. Apparently they have reduced the pool of available units to 3, which means the MW is going to be 33% of all LR occurrences at only 6 of 13 occurrences that means only 1 or 2 more than the average suggests. You simply have not been lucky to get less than average. Of course there is a possibility that MWs have a higher probability than the others, but it will require far bigger sample sizes to sure.[BR][BR]Silent Tempest said:Note: Light Ranged units weren't previously part of the Crystal tournament.Click to expand...[BR]True but irrelevant. All unit types now have a chance to appear in any tourney. That was one of the goals (bigger diversity) Inno outlined for the changes.[BR][BR]Silent Tempest said:There were 7 instances where there were 4/5 unique enemy troop types, i.e. nearly 25% of the time. However, whilst this is higher than in the last tournament (in Planks it was roughly 20%) the friendlier troop mix didn't make all these fights impossible. If this trend continues then this kind of difficulty is ACCEPTABLE. However, if the troop mix is purposefully friendlier in some and completely hostile in other tournaments then this occurrence percentage is TOO HIGH.Click to expand...[BR]I find 20 or 25 % of more than 3 types also acceptable, more would make it too close to the other option (\"completely random\") but much less would simply bring us back to what it was before, which is not necessary either, I like more diversity myself, the problems are in other places.[BR][BR]Troop mix is certainly going to be different in different tourneys, some will be harder, some easier, just as it has always been.

That wasn't the case in the past, as thx to the old tourney, it was worth it to invest into the tourney and make profit out of it. I could reduce my workshops, as i gained a good amount of enchantments. Same with factories.
