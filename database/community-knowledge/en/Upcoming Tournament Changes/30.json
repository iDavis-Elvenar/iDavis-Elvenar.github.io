It is now possible to hit a wall where progress is NEGATIVE for your cities performance. I agree this is only a problem for a few of the players in the game and not for the majority. But simply introducing the POSSIBILITY of this happening sounds like an incredibly stupid idea. Why would anyone do this? This is what needs to be balanced.[BR][BR]A second thing that needs to be balanced is the fact that in the current tourney system, many AWs have turned into being NEGATIVE for a cities performance. While there is an easy fix for this problem: Delete them all, this is not a good idea for a city building type of game, it is one of the main reasons why people hate the new tourney so much. This is a very good idea to send the developers to work on balancing! rather than making everybody delete their hard worked for AWs. At the very least make them teleportable so people can bring them back when the game changes t something more intelligent.[BR][BR]The 3 separate queues are hardly balancing any of the underlying problems. What they do is, they give everybody more troops, yes, it is very popular with people, because it is a tangible number that is easy to see, making things easier for them. However the difficulty never really was the problem in the first place. The raised difficulty was part of the necessary balancing of tourneys, so now instead of fixing the problems, they do something to counteract what was the main reason for doing all this in the first place, just to buy goodwill with people. Fine by me, but it is not a fix of any problem! Indeed it is introducing a BIG and NEW imbalance to the game, buy extremely favoring human over elven towns. Humans get an extra traing queue with high quality units, while elves get an extra training queue with cannon fodder, while both get a third queue with more cannon fodder. How on earth can this be called balancing???\t\tClick to expand...[BR]CrazyWizard said:\t\t\tI agree with both responders.[BR]There is no balance and this so called \"proof\" is no proof at all.[BR]From the start we pointed out the main flaws of this change. while changes are made, none of these changes solve the flaws we pointed out.[BR][BR]The closest they got is changing a value in the formula, but that value is not the problem. the formula itself is.[BR]Every other change is pointless.[BR][BR]It's like a wreck of a car with square wheels, you can totally fix and replace every single part of that car making it look like new, as long as you do not fix it's square wheels everything else is pointless. it serves no purpse nor does it fix or change anything about the car not working as intended as long as it wheels stay as squares.\t\tClick to expand...[BR]As a testimony of the only fellowship that is successful in completing the whole tournament (however at a huge cost each week), Iâ€™d like to say, especially to Inno and its representatives, that very few of my fellows do really appreciate or are happy with the new format, the new formula.[BR][BR]We had actually our first casualty last week with a dear team mate dropping the game altogether mainly due to those changes. And I can understand him, the disparity between players as to the adjustments they will need to do to keep up in the tournaments is huge.[BR]I have personally a hard time being happy with this formula also, if you consider my progress in general but especially in AWs, as with my 491! actual levels, I will need to get rid of at least 100 to be able to be competent in tournaments from now on .. (I know players who quit playing for less in the past - deleting an AW by mistake for instance..).. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love being challenged, and I understand that the tournament was getting a bit out of hand, but having to erase AWs, AWs that have been leveled up with time and effort is so cruel, wrong and almost irrational.[BR][BR]A few are talking around me that they are losing their fun in tournaments, and since they are mainly playing this game because of them, I do not want to bet on their longevity into the game if this format/formula is here to stay the way it is right now. Others wonder if they should indeed delete some AWs but are afraid to do so as it is irreversible and we are not sure if Inno is going to implement the AWs lvl coefficient in the end...[BR][BR]I support the majority of you who believe the formula is wrong, and that there is no real balancing. This is far from being an improvement and I hope itâ€™s not definitive because I donâ€™t see a lot of the main actual actors of the tournaments sticking to it.[BR][BR]Cheers! <o"}, {"15": "alsael said:\t\t\tSo,now we can \"safely\" research those optional squad upgrades,or not yet?\t\tClick to expand...The optional researches are currently not in the formula. Whether they are safe to complete or not is another matter.

They don't actually provide much benefit, other than easier province fighting, but I figure that can be kept on ice for a while.[BR][BR]I did delete two Ancient Wonders already (I'm sure someone asked us to report when we did so.) It may have been hasty, but they are two Wonders I could happily have lived without even without the tournament change. One is Endless Excavation. It did previously make sense to have that Wonder because it gave out a decent amount of free tools that weren't dependent on population and culture, but considering I had the excess population it made no sense for me to keep those extra AW levels hanging around my neck to hurt my tournament scores. I replaced it with another workshop. The second one was Lighthouse of Good Neighbourhood. That was a fun project of mine. I think it looks really cool and it was helping quite a bit with my culture bonus, but there was no sense continuing the experiment as it was only hurting me.[BR][BR]To be clear, I'm very bitter about deleting Ancient Wonders. I'm bitter that I would even have to be considering it to myself. I really hope that Inno are going to see some sense and amend the formula where they are concerned so not too many others feel the need to do the same and so I don't have to remove any others."}, {"1": "malph said:anonglitch you said The fact that the time is extended is a blessing because, in other words, we are saying, \"We are working on making the tournament better for everybody,\" and that is positive if you look at the big picture, who cares what happens at Elvenar US, for example.[BR][BR]well i dont think its a blessing more of a curse to be honest and I care what is happening on other servers  ..As we are the new test centre we are losing a massive amount of troops testing this and now we get told we got another 3 weeks testing thats even more troops lost and what do we get  less rewards as cant do so much prov  .but the other servers got the blessing of not having to do this testing Click to expand...[BR]Hello,[BR][BR]Well, to be honest, you shouldn't.
