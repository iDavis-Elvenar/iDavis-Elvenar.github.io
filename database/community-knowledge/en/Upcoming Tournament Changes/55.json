The more streamlined format of the new tournaments means many of us have substantially increased our scores, such that we are now only limited by our resources.[BR][BR]We really like the fact that 10 chests is within reach for a fellowship like ours, whereas previously it could only be achieved by a relatively small amount of high achieving fellowships, who had the means to put in huge amounts of time and resources, which was always going to be beyond us."}, {"30": "Pauly7 said:\t\t\tThe difficulty change is in.
