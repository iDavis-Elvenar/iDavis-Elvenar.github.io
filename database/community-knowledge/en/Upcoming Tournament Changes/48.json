[BR][BR]First and Foremost let me confirm that yes, we are all players and have been for quite some time. If we were not, then we would not be able perform this role even at a basic level. Secondly our role here is to Moderate. This means we ensure that the Forum Rules are being adhered to, we are a first point of contact for any queries, and we are also the guys that feed back any issues/concerns up the ladder. In view of us being the bridge between yourselves and the Devs, we will often notify you of changes, and then request feedback concerning those (hence this thread) let me confirm however that we are not involved with these changes, we merely voice them. [BR][BR]In addition, whilst some of us may on occasion discuss our personal gameplay, we will never give our opinions on recent changes. We are here to listen to your opinions and feed those back, we are here to steer your threads and ideas to the correct places, not inflame them further. We need to be impartial in everything we do to ensure this.[BR][BR]We will never cherry pick certain comments due to their positivity or negativity for that matter. As long as it is in line with Forum Rules, it stays.[BR][BR]Now, regarding your concerns regarding the Tournament Feedback (and I apologise if you feel this is too positive in its delivery) we have forwarded your Feedback to the Devs, and we continue to do so, including the discord amongst you. There is no conspiracy to keep information from you, we have been given a task, and we are fulfilling that task. Had we any information concerning your questions we would provide you with it.

I am ranked among the top players in our FS and our FS is in top 20 in the world. I usually did around 10 provinces, recently started doing more - 15 was a usual number, and if I felt the need, I went to around 20 provinces. Mostly because of the number of clicks, that was cumbersome, not because I wouldn't be able to go farther. My only boost was from the phoenix, didn't feel the need to use any other, as I had no problems doing the 15-20 provinces without any. I also did the Spire to the top, first two tiers fighting, third tier I switched to diplomatic. Shortly before the tourney change I tried using the DA and MMM to fight the third tier and it went smoothly, so I was happy I could save some resources (especially orcs) for upgrades of buildings. Also, if timed right, I could use the DA and MMM for two weeks of the Spire - so I would save them, as they're not so common to get.[BR]However, since the new tourney system, I started to get beat at around province 9-10 (second round) when I only had the Phoenix fed! By beat I mean wiped out! These used to be a breeze! Also, doing more than 15 provinces weekly even with a DA, MMM and ELR + phoenix is unsustainable for me. This means if our FS needs the top players to step up to reach 10 chests, I can do more provinces but I have to be prepared for heavy losses of either troops or resources in catering.[BR]I have not researched my limits after which I'm not able to fight or cater any more, as I am not willing to spend all my buff buildings, time instants and pet food for the brown bear, along with resources which took a long time to collect just for the testing I did not agree to.[BR]I am aware the tournament needed some changes in difficulty but this seems quite steep from a very early stage."}, {"65": "what I may not have said before and what really bothers me is that all the weeks with the new system are too similar. can be used in over 20 provinces almost only frogs and blossom mages, sometimes rarely rangers or others.

What has changed that week? has it changed for the better, worse or about the same than previous week/s and prior to the adjustments?\t\tClick to expand...I'm struggling to figure out what you are driving at here. Are you saying that adjustments have been made since last week's tournament, or the one before? The only adjustment I'm aware of being made since the testing started on EN was the very very minor tweak to the difficulty curve in the first ten provinces. That change was not significant enough for anyone to be able to discern. (I'm leaving aside the separated training queues as that doesn't have any impact on the combat.) If there have been other changes then that would be a good thing for us to be let know about.[BR][BR]Most people's main problems with the new tournaments are fundamental. We're not (or at least I'm not) complaining over whether one week is a little easier, or harder, or has variations from, the previous week. There's no point reiterating the same things over and over, as you say, but those same problems still exist and we aren't seeing any response to them. There have been very detailed descriptions of what the issues are, from a lot of people. It isn't a case of people just saying \"I don't like the changes.\" What is the best way to now proceed with feedback?[BR][BR]My comments on the last two tournaments specifically, however - I can say that I found the elixir tournament last week to be by far the easiest so far, and from what I've seen of magic dust this week - it has been by far the hardest. In the old dust tournaments I would expect them to be difficult because of the need to use the poor light melee troops, but strangely I have used almost zero light melee during my first round today.[BR][BR]My \"medium term\" feedback, is that I believe the tournaments have been made much too easy to begin with and then much too hard too quickly, meaning more people are funnelled into very similar looking scores and that removes much of the interest from it as a competition. (I said all that a day or two ago.)[BR][BR]To stress again, though, I have no complaint with one tournament feeling different to the next. I actually enjoy playing these tournaments more than the old ones. I also don't mind that my tournament average has been reduced from 11-12k to 6-7k. What I do mind, though (and yes I'm probably into triple figures the numbers of times I've said this now, on different forums) is fundamentally how the tournament formula has been put together. For as long as they insist on keeping a system where progress is punished - and punished very severely - then all the \"fine-tuning\" feedback regarding specifics, is all kind of pointless, and I will believe that these tournaments are close to broken. If the developers decide to start communicating and let us know that they are working on ways to disentangle the mess with Ancient Wonder and expansion impact - well that is the feedback that we are waiting for."}, {"30": "Silmaril said:\t\t\tEach Tournament brings a slightly different challenge to the game with varying strategies that may or may not have worked sucessfully before.[BR]What would be useful rather than players just reiterating they dont like the changes, would be quantifiable reasons why.
