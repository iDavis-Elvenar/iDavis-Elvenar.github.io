I struggle with the short codes and letters others use. I think in colour. Just the way my brain works, so thought it was obvious.

That's another 10 pages worth of communications and feedback from a community that has loudly and clearly expressed a fundamental issue with the Tourney system. I've added a comment here and there before but today I want to address a specific issue of this thread: its moderators.[BR][BR]I want to believe that you are actually nice people. Good and honest human beings. I really want to.[BR]But the way you deflect or shy away from answering questions, giving vague and veiled responses or couch your replies with positivity is driving me up the wall.[BR][BR]I doubted that any of you moderators actually play the game until that one comment from Silmaril not long ago saying that you couldn't keep up with Troop production.

Perhaps that way you can help school us in how to play this game better. What advice would you have for us so that we can continue to enjoy the game as you have?[BR][BR]Cause the alternative is that you don't actually play the game, and therefore are out of touch with the community because what we are experiencing you have no real clue about.[BR][BR]And if you are struggling as we are, how can you sit there, comfortably in your homes, facing the computer being a moderator of a forum thread exploding with feedback and still pretend that its all smiles and happy faces? And one among you even has the gall to ask us to be less negative about this whole sham. That would be extremely dishonest of you moderators then, if you are being punished like we are and yet wear that mask of neutrality. You may well ask what is the good of having forum moderators being as frustrated as we are? Well, it means that the community as a whole is rejecting this new system and would appreciate a thorough revision of its workings. It'll help me, if for nobody else, reconcile with how you dare bring in that cheery disposition insisting all is well and all will be fine when it hasn't. Because as long as you maintain that position, I cannot trust this team of moderators. There is a disconnect between the community and the community moderators when there is no transparency.[BR][BR]Bring in one of your developers in here and have him/her chat with us.

Putting extra stress on the forum mods or support mods.[BR][BR]What moderators are allowed to do tho, is post with their player accounts, and maybe some have already done that here.

I agree that sometimes the responses can be frustrating when we keep seeing the same positive spin pasted back to us when we perhaps don't feel positive... but the mods are only acting on whatever information they can get from the devs. Understandably they aren't going to be openly critical of the game or the information they're getting."}, {"90": "But I don't understand, why won't they be openly critical of the game or the information they are getting? It is as they professed it, their beloved game! So unless there is a disconnect between us and the moderators, surely then, even they would know and be able to see that there are urgent issues to the new Tourney system. [BR][BR]If they are volunteers who agree to moderate willingly out of their passion for the development of the game, what would be so criminal if they were as critical of the new system as we are? That's the one advantage of volunteering: if you don't like it, you can walk out! What is the worst anyone can do to them? [BR][BR]In fact, if they had been critical of this new update there'd be empathy between us and them. I wouldn't feel like I'm talking to a brick wall over and over again.

And if they say nothing you accuse them of ignoring us. But if they are not getting anything from the devs those are the only 2 options, what else can they do? Ofc a mod is not going to express thier disatisfaction with the game even if they feel the same way as as we do. And ofc they will be trying to put positive spins.
