As it's gone live it shouldn't matter anymore.[BR][BR][BR][BR]Do you prove any of the above? [BR]About infaltion it's simple. If you put out more money in circulation it will lead to inflation. In Elvenar you can see kp as the currency (or most valuable commodity). The more kp that is put out the more inflation, easy.[BR]And it's not only those hardcore players that are affected, a lot of other players will also be earning less kp. Also we might have different definition of hardcore, but for me a hardcore player would just soldier on regardless the odds and not complaining that it gets to difficult.

Doing less in tournaments with more loses than before (I let the numbers for brighter players than me) means less troops for Spire, which leads to less CC, time boosters which leads to less crafting in MA, less possibilities to feed the Bear and cover the loses of a tournament. Also doing less in tourny means less relics and less spells (lets let aside for the moment the decrease of the KPs income) meaning less possibilities to produce CC spells > crafting > harder to get Military 5 days boost (not that we have sooo many recipes of them) which goes back to less completed provinces in tourny.[BR]Bottom line, this new formula is harming us in many ways, reducing the game to hours of waiting for upgrades and not much else to do."}, {"73": "Killiak said:\t\t\tRegardless of that, any winky comments on \"soldiering on\" and \"would not complain\" are irrelevant and one could even argue you are trying to close down the discussion and arguments from those people.

I have in beta a city that is smaller, chapter V, and can do easier its 10 provinces than the big city in Winyandor. I am going for 25, 25, 10, 10, 10, 10 and see how it goes, without using any booster buildings.[BR][BR]Next week I will try with DAs and one of each temporal building and see how it goes. Its a challenging change, that is for sure. Let's see how things pan out [smilie--sprite1][BR][BR]I am sure that cave over there will be something... I am thinking though, and @30158729 and @Silmaril that perhaps, using an array of military temporal buildings, balancing military AW with non-military ones, and using an array of different troops it seems to be better fighting than catering, although the squad sizes are huge. It requires (a lot more) strategy, not sure. With this heavy shift, maybe INNO has more ideas to be implemented after or to hopefully get it a bit easier. Something with that cave, new craftable buildings,etc. Sure it's a massive spike in difficulty, but they will balance it out with something else, I am positive. They made a lot of changes from the first Spire to our current, and I climbed them entirely weekly, the Spire is like my second residence. Really good views.[BR][BR]I will update at the end of the tournament, and next week I will try with one DA, one UUU, one ELR, and one MMM and try to auto-fight it out, again to push to 25, 25, 10, 10, 10, 10. See how it goes.[BR][BR]Edit: I did complete the research for a couple of SSs that I had filled up, but not researched right now.

Tell me what is making you thing this is the easier option?\t\tClick to expand...Thank you for the quick reply.[BR][BR]In case I'm not clear, the ratio of enemy troops to our troops are far too high so that if the combination of troops is awkward then it makes the battles effectively unwinnable without manually fighting which is time consuming and can't be done on mobile devices.[BR][BR]Have a look at this photo. I have 41821 troops versus 92425 for the enemy. The enemy has more that 2.2x as many troops as I have and with there being 4 different types of squads there - HM, HRx2, LR and LM - that's a mad battle to have to face as the enemy can overpower our squads.[BR][BR]In comparison for this same battle in the old tournament style, multiplied by 4 to make it like for like, it would have been 29670 versus 29670. Even at 6th Star previously it would have been just 29670 versus 47,472[BR][BR]So the enemy squads have gone up more than 3x as much as it was before while my squads only gone up a third. This makes battles punitive. I don't mind the costs going up, even considerably up, to make it difficult but to make it this unreasonable isn't fair. If our troops went up at the same rate as the enemy troops have gone up then it would make the tournament more expensive still but to give these ratios of enemy troops to our troops is wrong.[BR][BR]Does that make sense @Silmaril ?[BR][BR]This could be fixed by capping the ratio of enemy squads to our squads - even if our squads went up faster."}, {"27": "Iâ€™m an app player.
