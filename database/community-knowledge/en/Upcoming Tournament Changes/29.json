So yes a new balance was a good idea.[BR][BR]The big problem is that the new formula has introduced a mathematical problem. It is now possible to hit a wall where progress is NEGATIVE for your cities performance. I agree this is only a problem for a few of the players in the game and not for the majority. But simply introducing the POSSIBILITY of this happening sounds like an incredibly stupid idea. Why would anyone do this? This is what needs to be balanced.[BR][BR]A second thing that needs to be balanced is the fact that in the current tourney system, many AWs have turned into being NEGATIVE for a cities performance. While there is an easy fix for this problem: Delete them all, this is not a good idea for a city building type of game, it is one of the main reasons why people hate the new tourney so much. This is a very good idea to send thedevelopers to work on balancing! rather than making everybody delete their hard worked for AWs. At the very least make them teleportable so people can bring them back when the game changes t something more intelligent.[BR][BR]The 3 separate queues are hardly balancing any of the underlying problems. What they do is, they give everybody more troops, yes, it is very popular with people, because it is a tangible number that is easy to see, making things easier for them. However the difficulty never really was the problem in the first place. The raised difficulty was part of the necessary balancing of tourneys, so now instead of fixing the problems, they do something to counteract what was the main reason for doing all this in the first place, just to buy goodwill with people. Fine by me, but it is not a fix of any problem! Indeed it is introducing a BIG and NEW imbalance to the game, buy extremely favoring human over elven towns.

Either you are not familiar with the game, which is kind of sad coming from a representative of Inno, or you are hoping that we are not familiar with it, which is kind of insulting. First: the spire never depended on the map squad size. Second: since the old tournament operated with the percentages of your SS and the AWs are producing a certain percentage of your SS this researches made zero impact on the AW production as far as the tournaments are concerned. And third: now you made a system where it's beneficial to not progress in the research tree at all after the chapter 15 (unless chapter 17 brings something truly amazing to beat the 27% increase in the research multiplier), where it's beneficial to never build a good half of the AWs and where it's beneficial to use as few expansions as possible.

It's a collective of all that brings changes to prizes, tournaments, events, etc.\t\tClick to expand...It might be hard for players to look at the big picture if they don't know what's to come and whether the future of the game justifies the current changes to the tournament. If the devs want us to be more understanding of the changes they should give us some hints about what's planned and why this nerf was necessary. However the only explanation we got is that this will make the tournament more enjoyable for everyone and as it's obvious from the response on the forum that's clearly not the case.[BR]Since we don't know about the game's future plans we can only go on on the info we currently have and based on that it looks to me like some players here are looking at the big picture more than the devs.[BR]For instance, including the AWs in the formula forces players to chose between being tournament oriented or developing their city to the fullest. That's becasue the claim that upgrading Aws will always be more beneficial than the penalty it brings is simply not true.[BR]Let's take the case of the sunset towers. Upgrading them would improve some aspects of my city but has no direct impact on the tournament whatsoever. One could argue that by upgrading it we can remove a building that produce seeds and place an armoury in it's place. Well I've done the maths and, putting aside that one might not need another armoury or factory (they might need space for a guest race for instance), if I'd upgrade my ST to level 30 I might get almost as much seeds per day as I would get from 2 amuni ships (and that's including what I get from less decay too, not just what I get from the chests). So yeah, in that space I might be able to place an armoury. But we are talking about a 30 level AW here, the amount of time and kps to get there... lol.[BR]And the biggest problem being that the difficulty those 30 levels would add to the tournament (or rather the tournament SS) could never be compensated by anything we could place in that spot. So we are forced to chose: do we want to be able to do more in tournament or to develop our cities. Did the devs take that into consideration? Can we get an answer form them why some wonders that have nothing to do with the tournaments are included in the formula?[BR]Another question is: what are we supposed to do with kps once we reach a certain point? Let's say we can't use them in the tech tree for various possible reasons (my current is super slow production in chapter 15). We can upgrade our military wonders to find the right balance between difficulty and benefits and what then? Upgrading the other wonders that would help our city in other ways will just break the balance again. So I really feel the devs should reconsider some wonders and leave them out of the formula. We really need to be able to progress in other aspects of the game without being punished in the tournaments/spire for that.[BR][BR][BR]anonglitch said:\t\t\tFor example, skipping squad sizes was a good option due to the prior tournament's and Spire's format.

Researching optional SS upgrades was harmful before but not all players knew about it and by the time they discovered it the damage was already done and they couldn't unlearn it. Now researching them would bring us some benefits but what if the devs change things again? The optional researches are currently not included in the formula, how do we know they won't change it?[BR]The  AWs were advertised as the best thing in this game and players invested a lot in them and now suddenly they bring penalties with them. Same goes for expansions. We can't unlearn tech, and we can't downgrade Aws and we can't teleport them. And we can't remove expansion either. If you keep changing the rules of the game ofc the players will be unhappy and won't trust the Elvenar team and what they say.[BR][BR]anonglitch said:\t\t\texpansions will make a smaller impact in both the tournament and the Spire (so the Spire gets a bit easier as a \"side effect\").\t\tClick to expand...This is not true for me. The Spire got more difficult because what you removed form expansion you added to techs. My Halflings city used to be able to complete the Spire with some difficulty but it could, now it's almost impossible. My Elvenar city used to do it without major problems, now it's draining much more resources.[BR][BR]I think most players here agree that the tournament needed to be adjusted as we were getting too many rewards, but what they disagree is on the way it was done. Cap the prizes, or add some other new kind of difficulty. (4* enemy troops, magic keys one needs to collect/craft/whatever to be able to fight in provinces higher than whatever Inno thinks is the acceptable limit etc) just don't go an change core aspects of the game on which people have worked hard for years and don't force us to chose if we want to just do tournaments or develop our cities."}, {"45": "@malph As per our announcement linked to this discussion thread; ''The new Tournaments will not go to further Live worlds than EN for at least another 3 weeks after the start of the first new Tournament on EN''"}, {"122": "@Silmaril [BR]This is the 3rd week of testing on EN   [BR]What i would like to know is after this tournament ends  what is going to happen ???[BR]As you said  it was announced   it was a 3 week test   [BR]can i get a reply please"}, {"84": "anonglitch said:\t\t\tI am definitely no parrot repeating the same thing.\t\tClick to expand...[BR]I take it that this is in relation to the comment i made on the A game should be fun this is becoming a chore thread so let me correct you on something. I did not say you were a parrot i said if you keep on saying that \"feedback is passed to the devs\" and \"changes have been made\" that you would start to sound like a parrot.

Quite a few players good at stats have suggested variations to the formula, others have suggested other ways of making this better and so far one of the suggestion them has been implemented: 3 separate queues which I think will be a good thing, at least for me.
