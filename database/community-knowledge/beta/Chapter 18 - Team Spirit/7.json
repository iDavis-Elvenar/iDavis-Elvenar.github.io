The portal, magic residences and magic workshops are absolutely beautiful. Congrats to the designers!I am happy to only see fair trades on the market.  Love to see that nobody can \"abuse\" the system especially that we are all looking after the same goods (at the beginning of the chapter).Happy to see that the settlement size will have a reasonable size overall, unless I miscalculate my needs [smilie--sprite2]Happy to see new province expansion limit (don't know if this was related to chap 18 or not but I am happy to have it)[BR]      NEGATIVES[BR]The new mechanic of the superior trader with the merchants seems to be an extreme limiting factor since we have reach a critical base of players producing ascended goods.  We'll see how thi evolve but I am not thrilled at all.  It would help to have visibility on our merchants availability (something like we have for the builders), showing us how many are available for trades.  I can't see myself sorting notifications to look for that, nor to go back frequently on the merchants's view of the trader to find out.  This is not very well designed.It would be usefull to see our own ascended goods trades too as we do for all other goods.  Maybe this is a bug?Unurium production is too much of a limiting factor.  I can't progress in the research, do upgrade and produce ascended goods with only one part time unurium source... I am also stuck on seeps production being too low to run my sensitive manufatories, even if I have over a dozen of buildings producing seeds in addtion of the part time seeds production at the trader.  My suggestion would be to modify the trader so we can produce both, seeds and unurium, at the same time.  that's it for now [smilie--sprite1][BR]Ange"}, {"152": "Are the merchant unlocks with diamonds permanent or temporary?"}, {"16": "all merchants are hired for 20 days"}, {"9": "Merchant's capacity increased from 1800 to 2000 after upgrading Main Hall from lv39 to 40.[BR]Just anybody knows what to expect from this marvelous chapter..."}, {"16": "That was known and expected from announcement and in-game help.

Spending diamonds for the 4th and 5th merchants should not be something that has to be repeated every 20 days. That needs to be changed before this goes to the Live worlds. I have always said that I would never quit playing until there were no more chapters, but this forced repeat diamond spending, in order to get through the chapter a little faster, is wrong, and might be the thing that sours me on this game. @Marindor I hope Inno is paying attention to this."}]
