My point was that many smaller players make strategic use of the old, cycling quests to help with growth (for example I have one such player in my H world FS) and that they would miss that opportunity.

There were 3 quests that helped me there -1) collect 16000 supplies,2) collect 6 advanced tools and 3) collect 2 advanced tools and 200000 coins. With  the amount of visitors that I had I could easily clear 500000 coin and 50000 supplies each and every day. I also used 3 other cycling quests when I was completing provinces - 1) solve 4 encounters, 2) complete a province and 3)  gain 4 relics. Today I set out to pick up 5 expansions in my city - and while it went a lot quicker without having all of the incessant clicking - I did not get any of the rewards that would have been available with the cycling quests. Now with those rewards I usually bought goods from the trader but now it is going to take longer to accrue the inventory that I am trying to build.[BR]Now under the new system that we have we get 4 weekly quests ?? Those I finished the first day - so now I must wait till the next ones come out. And the daily quests are  joke - one tells me to use a spell and another to disenchant one - seems like there is no cohesiveness in them - they certainly are not helping me to \" build\" a city, rather they seem to be just random ideas that somebody has designed to strip the individual incentives from the game."}, {"136": "For me the weekly timer reset but did not get any new weekly quests.
