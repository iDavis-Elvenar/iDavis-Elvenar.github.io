        The Kitchen Event brings a new mechanic that is completely new to Elvenar! The core of this mechanic lies in completing the customers' demands.
        These are known as customers' offers and you can see the offers in the right part of the event window. There are 12 offers
        in total of which 3 can be visible at the same time (that's the similar principle to our previous events with rotating chests).<br><br>

        Your task begins with the event questline, where you can earn Chef Hats <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4tYSS6K/EL-akcia-august-2022-event-currency-1.png" style="height: 15px; margin-bottom: 3px;">.
        You need Chef Hats to spawn Dishes on your board, combine them and fulfill various customers' offers that the Kitchen Event generates for you.<br><br>

        To spawn Dishes on your board, click one of the Stockpiles placed at the bottom of your event screen. Each Stockpile generates a different
        set of Dishes, so make sure to hover over a respective stockpile before you perform the spawning process and see where you can get the required
        items.<br><br>

        To find your required dishes, let's take a closer look at different customers' offers in the right part of the event window.

        <div class="row" style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <center><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zGqZM7B/EL-akcia-august-2022-offers.png"></center>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                Three customers' offers can be seen at the same time. You can always <b>Decline</b> any offer you wish (by clicking the Trashcan button)
                or you can decide to complete it and earn rewards. By hovering over any of the three offers you can see what is the set
                of possible prizes you can receive.<br><br>
                While you are considering whether your current offer is beneficial for you or not, you may also consider the cost of the required Dishes.
                Take a look at <b>Offers</b> and <b>Dishes</b> tab to see all the available customers' offers in this event and how to calculate the cost of respective
                offers.<br><br>
                A new customer's offer appears immediately after you complete one, but when you use the Decline button, you need to wait 30 minutes
                for a new one to appear. One of the event strategies lies in realizing how to maximize the number of completed offers during the day
                when your favorite daily prize is active, while only completing the most beneficial offers, so that you maximize the chance for receiving
                the daily prize.

        Not everytime the spawning process alone will be sufficient for completing your offers. Take a look at the <b>Dishes</b> tab to see that every
        type of game dish contains 6 different levels, differing in their value and look. It is more likely that the Stockpile will generate the low-level 
        dish and in order to obtain the high-level one, you need to combine 2 identical dishes in the kitchen. This is where the merging part of this event comes into play
        and all of that situated in your event kitchen:<br><br>

        Take a look at the <b>Dishes</b> and <b>Offers</b> tabs to see more closely how the merging process works.<br><br>
        
        One of my favorite aspects of this event is managing the space. The board is of 9x5 size, which means that only a limited number
        of dishes can be spawned (merged) at the same time. These dishes consist of various types and levels, so it is very easy to create
        chaos on your board. The constant need to tidy up your space and to actually bring some order out of chaos is in my opinion one of
        the best aspects of this event.<br><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Group your dishes!</b> When you run into a new offer and perform the spawning process too many times, a lot of new dishes 
              start occupying your space. It is a good rule to try grouping your pieces on the board and splitting them up into different sections of the kitchen.
              You can use the left corner for Hot Chocolates for example, the middle room for Lime Desserts and the right corner for Delicious Roasts.
              Inside the sectors the dishes can be sorted as well (e.g. by their levels). This will ease your merging process, especially if you
              are not familiar with the look of different dishes and levels at the beginning of the game.</li>
          <li><b>Do not spawn too many dishes!</b> You can guess how many times you need to click the Stockpile button in order to
              merge the dishes you need (take a look at the <b>Dishes</b> tab). This will prevent you from having many unused dishes on your board and 
              prevent the need of using the Discard feature, which would make you lose your Chef Hats.</li>
          <li><b>Discard feature!</b> This feature may be helpful for you if your board gets messed up with other types of dishes than
              those you need for your current task, but if you keep the points above and all the hints from my other tabs in your mind, generally speaking you shouldn't 
              get into this situation, as the overall size of the board is sufficient for your needs. I have completed many customers' offers already and I didn't have to use this feature.</li>
