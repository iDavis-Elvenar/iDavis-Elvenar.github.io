        We know that each cup can generate even better piece than level 1 (with a decreasing chance). In case the spawning process generates a better piece than the one 
        needed in our task, it may seem like we have received a potentially useless piece for now (which could lead us to think that the worst-case scenario numbers
        calculated in the <b>Pieces</b> tab may get even worse), but we will certainly find a use for this piece in one of the very following tasks and that will reduce
        our costs markedly. So do not discard your high level pieces! Unless you are clicking the cups buttons too many times (and more than the number of level 1
        pieces you need), you shouldn't get into excess of your pieces in the board!<br><br>

        Considering the merging process from the <b>Pieces</b> tab and spawning process from the table above, we can visualize the whole gameplay mechanic.
        Use the <b>Play</b> button to start the visualization and click the respective <b>Merge</b> nodes to merge your generated pieces (if you already have some, of course).

        You can also use the <b>Step</b> button to have better control over the merging process.
