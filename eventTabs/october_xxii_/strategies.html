       The Misty Forest is my favorite event type as it is the only mechanic that allows players to fully pull out their
       strategic skills. Unlike rotating chests or shuffle board events, the tile event gives you much more responsibility on
       affecting the rewards and progress you receive (which in my opinion makes event much more interesting after all).<br><br>

       In the <b>Tools</b> tab we have described all the tools you have at your disposal. Each of the tools has its own special effect
       and it's up to you to use them as efficiently as possible! I'm going to describe several well proven strategies that may help
       you on your way to maximizing your rewards. (The content will be added soon).<br><br>

       <ul>
        <li><b>Soon</b> <!--When you run into a new task and perform the spawning process too many times, a lot of new pieces 
            start occupying your space. It is a good rule to try to group your pieces on the board and split them up into different sectors.
            You can use the left corner for Dwarven Figurines for example, the middle room for Dwarven Tools and the right corner for Dices.
            Even within these sectors the pieces can be sorted (e.g. by their levels) and that will ease your merging process, especially if you
            are not familiar with the look of different pieces and levels at the beginning of the game.--></li>
        <!--<li><b>Do not spawn too many pieces!</b> You can guess the approximate number of times you have to click the Cups buttons in order to
            merge the required pieces (take a look at the <b>Pieces</b> tab). This will prevent you from having many unused pieces on your board and 
            prevent the need of using the Discard feature, which would cause loosing your dwarven chips.</li>
        <li><b>Discard feature!</b> This feature may be helpful for you if your board gets too messed up with other types of pieces than
            those you need for your current task, but keeping the points above and all the hints from my other tabs in your mind, generally speaking you shouldn't 
            get there, as the overall size of the board is large enough. I have completed many tasks already and didn't need to use the Discard feature once.</li>
