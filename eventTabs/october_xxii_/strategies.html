       The Misty Forest is my favorite event type as it is the only mechanic that allows players to fully pull out their
       strategic skills. Unlike rotating chests or shuffle board events, the tile event gives you much more responsibility on
       affecting the rewards and progress you receive (which in my opinion makes event much more interesting after all).<br><br>

       In the <b>Tools</b> tab we have described all the tools you have at your disposal. Each of the tools has its own special effect
       and it's up to you to use them as efficiently as possible! I'm going to describe several well proven strategies that may help
       you on your way to maximizing your rewards. (The content will be added soon).<br><br>

       <ul>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Candle.</b> Candle reveals one single tile you click on and it is the only tool that can be used
            on a foggy tile. Out of all available tools, it's the most beneficial one towards moving forward in the forest. It can also
            come handy when you want to pick up rewards you left behind (and are placed far from each other) or to prepare your space for
            using other tools.
        </li>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Lantern.</b> Lantern is extremely useful for receiving information about the surrounding area.
        It can only be used on an already cleared tile and reveals a column of foggy tiles (the light won't float
        behind the obstacle, so make sure to use it on such a column, in which there are as little obstacles in the way as possible). You can maximize the information you receive by using lantern
        in such a column, that is surrounded by as many unrevealed tiles as possible (see 4:22 in the video below for further ilustration).
        </li>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Flash Flask.</b> Similarly to lantern, it can only be used on an empty tile. It is the best idea to use
        Flash Flask when many rewards are placed close to each other, but spread in different columns (see 4:05 in the video). It may
        also come handy if you just want to move forward in the forest but many obstacles are laid out in your way (see 5:00).
        </li>
        <li><b>What to focus on.</b> Find your goal in the event. There are 3 main strategies: 1) Focusing on Grand Prizes, 2) Focusing on
        Daily Prizes and 3) Going for everything. The difference between these is which rewards you focus on while you make your path
        in the forest. No matter which of the three strategies you choose, you should always keep in mind that picking up tools is most important
        and it will help you reaching all of these three goals! Then, depending on your goal, you may focus on the following: cat spirits (if
        you aim for Grand Prizes), lost items (if you aim for Daily Prizes) and just collect everything you find, if you have no
        specific prizes of the event you should adhere to.
        </li>
        <li><b>Do not clear every tile!</b> There are many rewards hidden inside the Misty Forest, but not all of them contain prizes. Learn
            about different states of the tiles: empty tile (when no more fog needs to be removed and you can immediately claim the reward),
            semi foggy tile (you can see whether it contains rewards or not but you need to clear the fog first before you can claim it) and
            the fully mist tiles (you cannot see whether it contains prizes or not and need to clear some of the adjacent tiles first to find out).
            You can take advantage of what you know about different states and use these tips to maximize your rewards. If you see that there
            is no reward hidden the semi foggy tile, there is no reason to clear it. Using your tools strategically will lead to maximizing
            your information about the surrounding tiles and minimizing the number of fully mist tiles you should leave behind!
