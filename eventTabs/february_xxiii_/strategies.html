       The Great Excavation is my favorite event type as it is the only mechanic that allows players to fully pull out their
       strategic skills. Unlike rotating chests or shuffle board events, the tile event gives you much better control over
       the rewards and progress you receive (which in my opinion makes the event much more interesting after all).<br><br>

       In the <b>Tools</b> tab we have described all the tools you have at your disposal. Each of the tools has its own special effect
       and it's up to you to use them as efficiently as possible! I'm going to describe several well proven strategies that may help
       you on your way to maximizing your rewards.<br><br>

       <ul>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Shovel.</b> Shovel reveals one single tile you click on and it is the only tool that can be used
            on a dusty tile. Out of all available tools, it's the most beneficial one towards moving forward in the city. It can also
            come handy when you want to pick up rewards you left behind (and if they are placed far from each other) or to prepare
            your space for using other tools.
        </li>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Bottled Wind.</b> Bottled Wind is extremely useful for receiving information about the surrounding area.
        It can only be used on an already cleared tile and it reveals a column of dusty tiles (the wind won't blow
        behind the obstacle, so make sure to wisely choose the column in which you maximize the affected area). You can also
        maximize the information you receive if you make sure that the surrounding columns 
        have as many unrevealed tiles as possible.
        </li>
        <li><b>Best ways of using Vacuum Vial.</b> Similarly to Bottled Wind, it can only be used on an empty tile. It is the best idea to use
        Vacuum Vial when many rewards are placed close to each other, but spread in different columns. It may
        also come handy if you just want to move forward in the city but many obstacles are laid out in your way.
        </li>
        <!--<li><b>What to focus on.</b> Find your goal in the event. There are 3 main strategies: 1) Focusing on Grand Prizes, 2) Focusing on
        Daily Prizes and 3) Going for everything. The difference between these is which rewards you focus on while you make your path
        in the city. No matter which of the three strategies you choose, you should always keep in mind that picking up tools is very important
        and it will help you with the completion of any selected goal! Then, depending on your goal, you may focus on the following: tablets (if
        you aim for Grand Prizes), lost artifacts (if you aim for Daily Prizes) and just collect everything you find, if you do not adhere
        to a specific event prize.
        </li>-->
        <li><b>Do not clear every tile!</b> There are many rewards hidden inside the Buried City, but not all of them contain prizes. Learn
            about different states of the tiles: empty tile (when no more dust needs to be removed and you can immediately claim the reward),
            semi-visible tile (you can see whether it contains rewards or not but you need to clear the dust first before you can claim it) and
            the fully dusted tiles (you cannot see whether it contains prizes or not and you need to clear some of the adjacent tiles first to find out).
            You can take advantage of what you know about different states of visibility and use these tips to maximize your rewards. If you see that there
            is no reward hidden the semi-visible tile, there is no reason to clear it. Using your tools strategically will lead to maximizing
            your information about the surrounding tiles and minimizing the number of fully dusted tiles you should leave behind!
        </li>
        <li><b>The Golden Eye!</b> This is the newest addition of the Great Excavation event! For each revealed tile which does not contain a reward
            your receive Power. Power is the resource to charge the Golden Eye and once it's fully charged, you can use its divine effect
            to reveal locations of all rewards within the currently visible area (but be careful, once it's fully charged, any additional Power collected
            will be lost). In other words, if you do not manage to get the most out of 
            the tools (using steps I have described above), any extra effect will be taken in favor of Golden Eye!
