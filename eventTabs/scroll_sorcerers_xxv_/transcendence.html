       Transcendence Buildings is the newest feature in Elvenar introduced by the <b>Magic of Yore</b> event! Some of the evolving buildings will now offer special effects once you evolve them to certain stages.
       An example of such a building is the main building of this event, the <b>Place of Convergence</b>:<br><br>

       <img id="building" src="https://i.ibb.co/djCVTzn/place-of-convergence.png" alt="undefined" class="center " style="height: 200px; margin-bottom: 15px;">

       When examining the evolution stages of these buildings, you will notice a special symbol at some of their final stages:<br><br>

       This indicates that the transcendence effects become available once you upgrade the building to this stage. Transcendence effects are temporary abilities provided by the building, 
       which you can activate using a new resource called Volatile Sigils <img src='https://i.ibb.co/pwnK74T/volatile-sigils.png' title='Volatile Sigils' style='width: 24px;'>.
       Some of these resources can already be collected through the Grand Prizes in this event (check the <b>Prizes</b> tab), and additional ways to obtain them will be introduced in the future.<br>
       You can extend the duration of the Transcendence effect at any time by using additional Volatile Sigils. However, each subsequent activation requires an increasing number of Volatile Sigils.<br><br>
