        One of my favorite aspects of this event is that we have to constantly care about our board and try to bring some order out of chaos.
        Many items can be spawned at the same time and it's a good rule to try to organize your items as much as possible. Especially in the early
        stage of the event when you are not fully familiar with items and their corresponding visuals, it's a good idea to split up the newly
        created pieces into different parts of the board and to make it even more precise, you may also want to sort your pieces according to their
        individual levels.<br><br>

        You can always use the Discard feature and removed an unused item from your board. This, however, should happen often as the board is quite large 
        and unless you are spawning too many items from cups to solve your tasks, you should always have some free space to perform your merging process.
          
          This is the only possibility to gain additional event currency during this event. Unlike in previous events, where additional event currency
          could be obtained directly from opening chests, this event brings more variability and allows us to not only receive the currency, but also various
          items required for the actual gameplay in the board (which, in my opinion, is a nice change).
