        One of my favorite aspects of this event is managing the space. The board has size of 9x5, which means that only a limited number
        of items can be spawned (merged) at the same time. These items consist of various types and levels and so it is very easy to create
        a chaos in our board. The constant need to tidy up our space and to actually bring some order out of this chaos is in my opinion one very nice aspect
        of this event.<br><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Group your items!</b> When you run into a new task and perform the spawning process too many times, a lot of new items 
              start occupying your space. It is a good rule to try to group your items on the board and split them up into different sectors.
              You can use the left corner for Dwarven Figurines for example, the middle room for Dwarven Tools and the right corner for Dices.
              Even within these sectors the items can be sorted (e.g. by their levels) and that will ease your merging process, especially if you
              are not familiar with the look of different pieces and levels at the beginning of the game.</li>
          <li><b>Do not spawn too many pieces!</b> You can guess the approximate number of times you have to click the Cups buttons in order to
              merge the required items (take a look at the <b>Pieces</b> tab). This will prevent you from having many unused pieces on your board and 
              prevent the need of using the Discard feature, which would cause loosing your dwarven chips.</li>
          <li><b>Discard feature.</b> This feature may be helpful for you if your board gets too messed up with other types of pieces than
              those you need for your current task, but keeping the points above and all the hints from my other tabs in your mind, generally speaking you shouldn't 
              get there, as the overall size of the board is great enough. I have already completed many tasks and didn't need to use this feature once.</li>
